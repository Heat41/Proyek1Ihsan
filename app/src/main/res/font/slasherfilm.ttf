Slasher Film Font Version 1.0

2022 Iconian Fonts - Daniel Zadorozny

While there are 28 fonts files in the ZIP package, there are really only 15 versions for 2 different base fonts.

The base fonts are "Regular" and "Rough."

The 14 versions for each base font are: Regular, Italic, Semi-Italic, Leftalic, Semi-Leftalic, 3D, 3D Italic, 3D Semi-Italic, Expanded, Expanded Italic, Expanded Semi-Italic, Condensed, Condensed Italic, and Condesned Semi-Italic.

The other 15 files are the same versions but are for the second base font, "Crossbow Head" where each capital letter has the arrowhead on the right of the character.

Note that you do not have to switch fonts in order to get the full arrow effect. Both base fonts, Shaft and Head, have their counterpart capital letters within each base font, and these can be found in the extended Latin character set - use of a character map program will assist in finding these characters.

So users can just use either the Crossbow Shaft or Crossbow Head font and still have access to all of the characters. However, for users who do not want to rely on using a character map, they can still get the same text effect by switching between the capital letters of the Crossbow Shaft and Crossbow Head fonts.

Also, if you want longer arrowheads and shafts, use the ` and ~ characters.
